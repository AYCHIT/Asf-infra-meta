# psf-infra-meta
Meta-repository for PSF backed or managed systems.

Created mainly for the issue tracker, since the actual work gets done
elsewhere, but some problems cross team boundaries, and for others it isn't
initially clear where the responsibility for resolution lies :)

For an overview of the technical details of the services the PSF operates,
see https://psf-salt.readthedocs.io/overview/ .
